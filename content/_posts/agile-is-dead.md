The year is 2019, agile is the standard for all modern software company. Scrum or Kanban, pick your flavor. OKRs is
part of common language.
Don't believe me? Ask the agile coach!

Daily stand-ups, retrospectives, post-its...

We lost track of what really matters: the mindset!

  **Transparent self-organizing customer focused teams**

* Transparent: Transparency implies openness and accountability.
  * Openness means the team knowledge, decisions and results are open and clear communicated, as well that the team is
  open to feedback and to collaborative work
  * The team takes responsibility for its acts and learn from its mistakes

* Self-organizing: teams need to be small, autonomous and be continuously evolving
  * Small teams to make possible for the team to be truly self-organizing
  * Autonomous means that it's up to the team to decide how they work better
  * Continuously evolving so the team can always adjust imperfections and keep everyone aligned on how to work together

* Customer focused: autonomous (again), data driven and delivering value constantly (and incrementally)
  * Autonomous so the team can decide on what to do to generate customer value (aligned with business goals and 
  strategy) and on how to do so
  * Data-driven, after all the ultimate goal of any customer facing team is to generate value for customers, and you
  can't improve what you can't measure
  * Small value is better than no value, that's why value throughput matters - also we need to acknowledge that no one
  knows our customers better than themselves, so we are always seeking their validation, and that's why we build
  frequent small measurable changes
